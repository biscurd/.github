# :cookie: Biscurd
We are trying to create a free, open-source, decentralized discord alternative.

Unlike Discord, we will never lock most of our features behind a paywall. Even if we do, the source code is widely available and can be modified easily to fix the problem. :shipit:

We run on donations. If you enjoy our services, please consider giving us a small [donation](#donation) so we can upgrade and remove the limitations for you guys. Thanks in advance :pray:

# :abc: Why the name?
The name combines the word biscuit + Discord, which becomes biscurd.
Why biscuit? Because biscuits are delicious.
